# Express Vue3 example


This is basic setup for vue 3, with typescript and express as development server. I prefer to configure webpack from scratch to have more control over my project. However, online resources and tutorials are more concentrated on using cli and auto generating tools, so setting up vue from scratch may be quite challenging for new developers.

### Features

- Vue.js 3
- Vuex 4
- TypeScript
- Webpack 5
- Express.js
