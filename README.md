# Vue3 project setup


This is basic setup for vue 3, with typescript and express as development server. I prefer to configure webpack from scratch to have more control over my project. However, online resources and tutorials are more concentrated on using cli and auto generating tools, so setting up vue from scratch may be quite challenging for new developers.

### Features

- Vue.js 3
- Vuex 4
- TypeScript
- Webpack 5
- Express.js

# Quick Start

Clone or fork the repository and after you get code run

```
# to install all dependencies
$ npm i

# to run server in development mode
$ npm run dev

# to build static files
$ npm run build

# to start server
$ npm start
```
